        <p> Divya Shanker was initiated in the divine art of Indian classical dance at a tender age of four by Guru Radha Aravind. She further trained under Guru Kalamandalam Saraswathy at Nrityalaya School of Dance in Kerala India where she perfected and embellished the unique styles of three dance forms of South India -- Bharatanāṭyaṁ, Mohiniattam and Kūchipūḍi. She is also trained in Kalaripayattu, an ancient Kerala martial art. At present she is under the tutelage of Bharathanatyam exponents, Guru N.Srikanth and Ashwathy Srikanth, who are the current "torch bearers" of the Nrityalaya School of Dance. 
            Divya has given performances in several places in India and Texas.
